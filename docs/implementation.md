## **Implementation Plan: BNO085 micro-ROS IMU Publisher**

This document provides a detailed development roadmap for building the firmware as specified in the PRD. The plan is structured into sequential phases, with each task building upon the previous ones.

### **Phase 1: Project Setup & Hardware Validation**

**Goal:** Establish a working development environment and confirm basic communication with the BNO085 sensor.

*   #### **Task 1: Initialize PlatformIO Project** ✅
    *   **Dependencies:** None
    *   **Context:** This task sets up the foundational structure for the entire project.
    *   **Subtasks:**
        *   [x] Install PlatformIO IDE extension in VSCode or install PlatformIO Core CLI.
        *   [x] Create a new PlatformIO project targeting the "Raspberry Pi Pico" board.
        *   [x] In `platformio.ini`, add the `Adafruit BNO08x` library to the `lib_deps` section.
        *   [x] Configure `platformio.ini` to set the `monitor_speed` for serial communication (e.g., 115200).

*   #### **Task 2: Implement Basic Sensor Communication** ✅
    *   **Dependencies:** Task 1
    *   **Context:** This task focuses on the hardware interface, ensuring the Pico can correctly talk to the IMU over I2C.
    *   **Subtasks:**
        *   [x] In `src/main.cpp`, include the necessary headers (`Wire.h`, `Adafruit_BNO08x.h`).
        *   [x] In the `setup()` function, initialize the primary serial port for debugging (`Serial.begin()`).
        *   [x] Initialize the I2C bus using `Wire.begin()`.
        *   [x] Instantiate the BNO085 object and call its `begin_I2C()` method, passing the I2C address (`0x4A`) and the `Wire` object.
        *   [x] Add a check after `begin_I2C()` to print a success or failure message to the serial monitor.
        *   [x] Enable the specific sensor reports required by the PRD: `SH2_GAME_ROTATION_VECTOR`, `SH2_GYROSCOPE_CALIBRATED`, and `SH2_ACCELEROMETER`.

*   #### **Task 3: Verify Raw Data Acquisition** ✅
    *   **Dependencies:** Task 2
    *   **Context:** This is the first testing milestone. It confirms that the sensor is not only connected but is also providing valid data.
    *   **Subtasks:**
        *   [x] In the `loop()` function, poll the sensor to check if data is available using the library's `getSensorEvent()` method.
        *   [x] If data is available, read the accelerometer values from `sensorValue.un.accelerometer.x/y/z`.
        *   [x] Print the formatted X, Y, and Z accelerometer values to the serial monitor.
        *   [x] **Intermediate Test:** Compile and upload the firmware. Open the PlatformIO Serial Monitor. Verify that you see the "Success" message from initialization and that a stream of accelerometer values is being printed. Physically move the sensor and confirm that the values change as expected.
        *   [x] **Hardware Validation Complete:** ✅ User confirmed hardware is working and sensor data is being received over serial.

### **Phase 2: Basic micro-ROS Communication**

**Goal:** Establish a communication link between the Pico and the ROS 2 host computer.

*   #### **Task 4: Configure micro-ROS Environment** ✅
    *   **Dependencies:** Task 1
    *   **Context:** This task adds the ROS 2 communication layer to the project. It can be done in parallel with Tasks 2 & 3.
    *   **Subtasks:**
        *   [x] In `platformio.ini`, add the `micro_ros_platformio` configuration.
        *   [x] On the Linux host, install the ROS 2 Jazzy toolchain.
        *   [x] Create and run the `micro-ros-agent` to listen for the Pico's connection (`ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent serial --dev /dev/ttyACM0`).
        *   [x] In `src/main.cpp`, add the minimal boilerplate code to set up the micro-ROS transport, allocator, node, and support structure.

*   #### **Task 5: Test Basic Communication** ✅
    *   **Dependencies:** Task 4
    *   **Context:** This is a critical integration point to confirm that micro-ROS is working before adding sensor data.
    *   **Subtasks:**
        *   [x] Set up a simple publisher that publishes a basic string message like `"Hello from BNO085 Publisher"` to a topic like `/bno085_status`.
        *   [x] Add a loop that publishes the string message every 1 second.

### **Phase 3: Core Feature Integration**

**Goal:** Combine sensor data acquisition with ROS publishing to create the core functionality.

*   #### **Task 6: Publish Real IMU Data** ✅
    *   **Dependencies:** Task 3, Task 5
    *   **Context:** This is the first major integration point, creating the primary data stream.
    *   **Subtasks:**
        *   [x] In the project, replace the `std_msgs/msg/String` publisher with a `sensor_msgs/msg/Imu` publisher on the `/imu/data` topic.
        *   [x] Create a high-frequency timer for micro-ROS set to the default **60Hz** (optimized for sensor data availability).
        *   [x] In the timer's callback function, read the Game Rotation Vector, Gyroscope, and Accelerometer data from the BNO085.
        *   [x] Populate the `orientation`, `angular_velocity`, and `linear_acceleration` fields of the `sensor_msgs/Imu` message structure.
        *   [x] For now, set all `covariance` array elements to `0.0`.
        *   [x] Publish the populated message.
        *   [x] **Intermediate Test:** Compile and upload. Run the agent. Use `ros2 topic echo /imu/data` to view the stream. Verify that the topic publishes at approximately 50Hz (`ros2 topic hz /imu/data`). Physically move the sensor and confirm that all data fields in the message change accordingly.

### **Phase 4: Robustness and State Management**

**Goal:** Implement the state machine, time synchronization, and visual feedback as defined in the PRD.

*   #### **Task 7: Implement Time Synchronization** ✅
    *   **Dependencies:** Task 6
    *   **Context:** This task ensures data can be correctly fused with other sensors in the ROS ecosystem.
    *   **Subtasks:**
        *   [x] In `setup()`, add the micro-ROS logic to synchronize time with the agent.
        *   [x] Implement a loop in `setup()` that waits until the first time sync is successful.
        *   [x] Before publishing the message in the timer callback, get the current synchronized time from micro-ROS.
        *   [x] Populate the `header.stamp` field of the `sensor_msgs/Imu` message with this time.
        *   [x] **Intermediate Test:** Echo the `/imu/data` topic and inspect the `header.stamp`. Verify the `sec` and `nanosec` fields are non-zero and correctly reflect the ROS system time.

*   #### **Task 8: Implement State Machine & LED Indicators** ✅
    *   **Dependencies:** Task 7
    *   **Context:** This makes the device's status transparent and its behavior robust to connection issues.
    *   **Subtasks:**
        *   [x] Define an `enum` for the states: `INITIALIZING`, `AWAITING_SYNC`, `OPERATIONAL`, `CRITICAL_FAULT`.
        *   [x] In `setup()`, configure the GPIOs for the Blue, Green, and Red LEDs as outputs.
        *   [x] Create a single function, `setLedStatus(State state)`, that implements the LED color/blink patterns specified in the PRD.
        *   [x] Refactor the code into a state machine. For example, the `loop()` function will check the current state and execute the appropriate logic.
        *   [x] Call `setLedStatus()` whenever the state changes.
        *   [x] Implement the logic for state transitions (e.g., move from `AWAITING_SYNC` to `OPERATIONAL` when `rmw_uros_epoch_synchronized()` returns true).
        *   [x] Add logic to handle a lost I2C connection (e.g., if `bno08x.begin()` fails) to enter the `CRITICAL_FAULT` state.
        *   [x] **Intermediate Test:** Power on the device without the agent running. Verify the Blue LED behavior for `INITIALIZING` and then `AWAITING_SYNC`. Start the agent and verify the LED turns solid Green. Stop the agent and verify the device returns to the `AWAITING_SYNC` state.

### **Phase 5: Advanced Features & Flexibility**

**Goal:** Implement the remaining high-value features: remote configuration, dynamic covariance, and calibration persistence.

*   #### **Task 9: Implement ROS Parameter Client** ✅
    *   **Dependencies:** Task 8
    *   **Context:** This decouples the firmware's configuration from the code, allowing for easy tuning.
    *   **Subtasks:**
        *   [x] Define a `struct` in the code to hold all configurable parameters (rate, timing, covariances).
        *   [x] Initialize an instance of this struct with the default values from PRD requirements.
        *   [x] In the `INITIALIZING` state, implement the micro-ROS parameter server to expose parameters to the host.
        *   [x] If the parameters are set externally, the system will use the new values.
        *   [x] If the parameters are not set, implement a fallback to use safe default values.
        *   [x] Use the values from the configuration struct throughout the application (e.g., for the timer period, covariance values).
        *   [x] **Intermediate Test:** The system operates using default parameters and can accept parameter changes via ROS parameter commands.

*   #### **Task 10: Implement Dynamic Covariance** ✅
    *   **Dependencies:** Task 9
    *   **Context:** This task makes the sensor "smarter" by reporting its own data quality.
    *   **Subtasks:**
        *   [x] In the `OPERATIONAL` state's publishing callback, query the BNO085 for the calibration status of the Gyroscope and Accelerometer (`getQuatAccuracy()`, etc.).
        *   [x] Write a helper function that takes a baseline covariance array, a calibration level (0-3), and the array of scaling factors, and returns the correctly scaled covariance array.
        *   [x] Before publishing, use this function to calculate the final covariance values for `orientation`, `angular_velocity`, and `linear_acceleration`.
        *   [x] Populate the message with these dynamically calculated covariance values.
        *   [x] **Intermediate Test:** Echo the `/imu/data` topic. Observe the initial high covariance values. Move the sensor in a figure-eight pattern to calibrate it. Verify that the diagonal values in the covariance matrices decrease significantly as the sensor reports better calibration.
